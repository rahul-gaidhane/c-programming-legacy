Note that if you had written `-k 2' instead of `-k 2,2' `sort' would have used all characters beginning in the second field and extending to the end of the line as the primary _numeric_ key. 
For the large majority of applications, treating keys spanning more than one field as numeric will not do what you expect.
Also note that the `n' modifier was applied to the field-end specifier for the first key. 
It would have been equivalent to specify `-k 2n,2' or `-k 2n,2n'.
All modifiers except `b' apply to the associated _field_,
regardless of whether the modifier character is attached to the field-start and/or the field-end part
of the key specifier.
Sort the password file on the fifth field and ignore any leading white space.
Sort lines with equal values in field five on the numeric user ID in field three:
$ sort -t : -k 5b,5 -k 3,3n /etc/passwd
An alternative is to use the global numeric modifier `-n':
$ sort -t : -n -k 5b,5 -k 3,3 /etc/passwd
