o In above output, we can see total arguments count is internally maintained by “argc” parameter of main() which holds value ‘7’
(in which one argument is executable name and ‘6’ are arguments passed to program).And, all argument values are stored in “argv” parameter of main() which is arr
ay of character strings. Here, main () function stores each argument value as character string. We can see, iterating over “argv” array, we can get all passed arguments in the program.
